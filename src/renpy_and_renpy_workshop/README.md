## Ren'Py and Ren'Py workshop

We're glad to see you here, now let's start creating!

### Purpose

To get you off your feet and using Ren'Py, this guide will _not_ teach you everything there is to learn about Ren'Py but rather
give you a good enough understanding of the framework so that you can begin to contribute.

### Prerequisite Knowledge

It is reccomended you read the Git section first, as you will not be able to collaborate with others without it.

### What is Ren'Py?

Ren'Py is a game framework (even though it calls itself an engine) that allows for the easy creation of visual novels,
with the use of Python scripting.

With built in:

- Rendering
- Input Handeling
- Font Rendering
- Filters
- Save system
- Audio Server

and much more.
