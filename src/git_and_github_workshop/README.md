## Git and GitHub Workshop

### Purpose

This is a crash course in Git and GitHub with the intent on providing enough information so that a student may begin to use Git for their personal projects and more importantly to begin to collaborate with others. This will just touch the surface and will not go into detail about troubleshooting. When issues arise, and they will, we hope the that the club can be a helpful resource to help troubleshoot along with the usual internet sources.

### Git

The most used distributed version control system in use today. Git tracks changes in files and allows for multiple people to work on the same codebase.

### GitHub

A platform and cloud-based service for software development that uses Git. GitHub offers feature rich free accounts and currently students qualify for Pro accounts. The platform is a great way to get started with version control and to begin to collaborate with your fellow students.
